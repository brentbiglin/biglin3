	<h2>iSchool Website Redesign</h2>
	<article>
		<p>As a UX Researcher and Designer for the School of Information at UT Austin, I recruited, managed, and mentored current UX students in redesigning the current website.</p>
		<img alt="iSchool website redesign timeline" class="inline" src="img/ischool-timeline.jpg">
		<p>Our <strong>Research Phase</strong> consisted of five teams:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Competitive Evaluation</li>
			<li>Content Audit and Inventory</li>
			<li>Heuristic Evaluation</li>
			<li>User Interviews</li>
			<li>Google Analytics</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Interviews gave us insights into our users' <strong>pain points</strong> and the most common tasks they seek to complete on the site. These tasks will be used during <strong>tree testing</strong> to assess our <strong>information architecture</strong>.</p>
		<blockquote>We interviewed students, faculty, staff, and industry professionals.</blockquote>
		<img alt="Animated gif of interview participants" class="right" src="img/ischool-interview-excerpt.gif">
		<p>In addition, the students conducted <strong>competitive analyses</strong> of 25 schools of information under my direction. I created an artboard for each school with the evaluative criteria pre-filled with questions so that new UX students could learn
			and contribute at the same time. <br><br> <em>"Is the website responsive or mobile-first?"</em> <br><br> <em>"Are standard elements (such as page titles, website navigation, page navigation and privacy policy) easy to locate?"</em> <br><br> The students
			filled in their respective artboards, which also provided them an opportunity to use and practice <strong>Sketch</strong>.</p>
		<img alt="Screenshot of Sketch artboards for the competitive evaluation" class="inline" src="img/ischool-sketch-comp-analysis.jpg">
		<p>Each artboard evaluated a particular school's website and was divided into the following categories:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Navigation and Information Architecture</li>
			<li>Accessibility and Simplicity</li>
			<li>Use of Media</li>
			<li>Being Mobile-First and Responsive</li>
			<li>Page Layout</li>
			<li>Aesthetic and Visual Design</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Students looked for specific standards like a 4.5:1 color contrast and alt-text accompanying images, according to <strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</strong>. Other evaluations were more heuristic in nature, so I individually audited the
			students' evaluations for consistency and accuracy. After the redesign is complete, we'll judge our work by the same metrics in order to demonstrate a measurable improvement in the site's user experience.</p>

		<p>We are currently working on the <strong>Design Phase</strong> of the project, after which this page will be updated.</p>
