		<p>My background in teaching Arabic and English and advising gives me insight into turning raw data into <strong>information that users can find, understand, and turn into knowledge</strong>. My experiences in different professional roles throughout my
			life have fostered in me an instinct for <strong>when to apply time-tested and reliable principles, and when to shift the paradigm and challenge the status quo</strong>.</p>
		<p>I utilize my interdisciplinary training to develop <strong>human-centered information architectures and designs</strong>. Advocacy for and fostering understanding among and between people has been the common thread throughout my professional career.</p>
		<p>To see what I mean, take a look at my <a href="portfolio.html"><strong>Portfolio</strong></a> and my <a href="https://github.com/brentbiglin"><strong>GitHub profile</strong></a>. For information about my education, qualifications, and experience, peruse my <a href="img/brent-biglin-resume.pdf"><strong>Resume</strong></a>.</p>
		<blockquote class="testimonial">
			<span class="quote">“</span> I have directly observed Brent’s skill-set in regard to <strong>user research, both generative and formative, and usability testing</strong> including developing a detailed test plan, recruiting participants, setting up
			tasks and scenarios to ensure he’s measuring the desired aspects of the design, execution of the usability test, and presentation of both preliminary and final results. <br><br> Brent is more than fluent in all aspects and has an <strong>ample "skills toolbox."</strong>			He is unique in that he has pursued, in parallel, knowledge in front-end development with the intention of being a <strong>better team mate</strong> when working with development teams. He has many years of industry experience which has helped him
			excel as a graduate student since he <strong>immediately finds ways to apply his academic learnings in an applied sense</strong>.<span class="endquote">”</span> <br><br> <strong>Eric Nordquist</strong> <br> Clinical Associate Professor, UT Austin
