	<h2>Conversational Design Guidelines</h2>
	<article>
    <p>As a contractor at a multinational computer technology company, I created a <strong>Conversational Design Guidelines</strong> document, the purpose of which is to be a resource for current and future design and development of conversational interfaces. Then I designed and created a <strong>conversational interface prototype</strong>, a virtual assistant, in order to validate and clarify those design guidelines through usability testing.</p>
		<blockquote>The design language for this type of interface is human language </blockquote>

		<p>Voice and <strong>conversational interfaces</strong> are increasingly becoming a significant part of our everyday interactions with technology. It is important for designers to follow brand guidelines and <strong>design principles</strong> that are informed by a number of disciplines, including but not limited to <strong>interaction design, content strategy, visual design, and linguistics</strong>. Rather than trying to teach the user the right way to speak or write, a conversational
interface <strong>accommodates users and allows them to express their commands and queries in the way that is most natural to them</strong>.</p>
<p>I gave participants a series of tasks to
complete with the prototype, changing the interfaceâ€™s responses and actions to empirically measure how participants perceived it. With this data, I was able to <strong>prioritize and highlight</strong> particular guidelines based on their <strong>efficacy</strong> to provide a model for future designers and developers at the organization.</p>
