"skills toolbox."</strong>	He is unique in that he has pursued, in parallel, knowledge in front-end development with the intention of being a <strong>better team mate</strong> when working with development teams. He has many years of industry experience which has helped him excel as a graduate student since he <strong>immediately finds ways to apply his academic learnings in an applied sense</strong>.<span class="endquote">”</span> <br><br> <strong>Eric Nordquist</strong> <br>Partner, Sentier Strategic Solutions, LLC <br>Clinical Associate Professor, UT Austin

        <h2>Conversational Design Guidelines</h2>
        <article>
            <p>As a contractor at a multinational computer technology company, I created a <strong>Conversational Design Guidelines</strong> document, the purpose of which is to be a resource for current and future design and development of conversational interfaces. Then I designed and created a <strong>conversational interface prototype</strong>, a virtual assistant, in order to validate and clarify those design guidelines through usability testing.</p>
            <blockquote>The design language for this type of interface is human language </blockquote>
            <img alt="An icon representing language with Roman and Chinese characters" class="right-noborder" src="img/guidelines.png">
            <p>Voice and <strong>conversational interfaces</strong> are increasingly becoming a significant part of our everyday interactions with technology. It is important for designers to follow brand guidelines and <strong>design principles</strong> that are informed by a number of disciplines, including but not limited to <strong>interaction design, content strategy, visual design, and linguistics</strong>. Rather than trying to teach the user the right way to speak or write, a conversational interface <strong>accommodates users and allows them to express their commands and queries in the way that is most natural to them</strong>.</p>
            <p>I gave participants a series of tasks to complete with the prototype, changing the interface’s responses and actions to empirically measure how participants perceived it. With this data, I was able to <strong>prioritize and highlight</strong> particular guidelines based on their <strong>efficacy</strong> to provide a model for future designers and developers at the organization.</p>

        <h2>iSchool Website Redesign</h2>
        <article>
            <p>As a UX Researcher and Designer for the School of Information at UT Austin, I recruited, managed, and mentored current UX students in redesigning the current website.</p>
            <img alt="iSchool website redesign timeline" class="inline" src="img/ischool-timeline.jpg">
            <p>Our <strong>Research Phase</strong> consisted of five teams:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Competitive Evaluation</li>
                <li>Content Audit and Inventory</li>
                <li>Heuristic Evaluation</li>
                <li>User Interviews</li>
                <li>Google Analytics</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Interviews gave us insights into our users' <strong>pain points</strong> and the most common tasks they seek to complete on the site. These tasks will be used during <strong>tree testing</strong> to assess our <strong>information architecture</strong>.</p>
            <blockquote>We interviewed students, faculty, staff, and industry professionals</blockquote>
            <img alt="Animated gif of interview participants" class="right" src="img/ischool-interview-excerpt.gif">
            <p>In addition, the students conducted <strong>competitive analyses</strong> of 25 schools of information under my direction. I created an artboard for each school with the evaluative criteria pre-filled with questions so that new UX students could learn and contribute at the same time. <br><br> <em>"Is the website responsive or mobile-first?"</em> <br><br> <em>"Are standard elements (such as page titles, website navigation, page navigation and privacy policy) easy to locate?"</em> <br><br> The students filled in their respective artboards, which also provided them an opportunity to use and practice <strong>Sketch</strong>.</p>
            <img alt="Screenshot of Sketch artboards for the competitive evaluation" class="inline" src="img/ischool-sketch-comp-analysis.jpg">
            <p>Each artboard evaluated a particular school's website and was divided into the following categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Navigation and Information Architecture</li>
                <li>Accessibility and Simplicity</li>
                <li>Use of Media</li>
                <li>Being Mobile-First and Responsive</li>
                <li>Page Layout</li>
                <li>Aesthetic and Visual Design</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Students looked for specific standards like a 4.5:1 color contrast and alt-text accompanying images, according to <strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</strong>. Other evaluations were more heuristic in nature, so I individually audited the students' evaluations for consistency and accuracy. After the redesign is complete, students will judge our work by the same metrics in order to demonstrate a measurable improvement in the site's user experience.</p>

    <h2>UXPA 2017 Student Design Contest</h2>
    <article>
        <p>At the <strong>UXPA 2017 Conference</strong> in Toronto, two classmates and I <strong>researched, designed, and prototyped</strong> a smart household assistant application called <strong>CacheCart</strong> in two and a half days.</p>
        <div class="video-container video-container-16x9">
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Kc1mK4s8DEY?rel=0" class="video-container" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>We first explored the <strong>problem space</strong> of grocery shopping to find a <strong>pain point</strong> that we could improve: the <strong>waste of groceries</strong>.</p>
        <img alt="Shopping cycle for groceries" src="img/cachecart1.jpg" class="right">
        <p>We distributed an online <strong>survey</strong> that received 174 responses within a matter of hours and several qualitative <strong>in-person interviews</strong> with conference attendees. The data showed that shoppers are very concerned with <strong>saving money and reducing waste</strong>.</p>
        <img alt="Selection of user research results" src="img/cachecart-user-research.svg" class="inline">
        <p>Therefore, we focused on <strong>expiration date notification</strong> in an intelligent and user-centered checklist. The application is <strong>accessible</strong> in that any action could be taken either by touching and typing or by voice. Based on <strong>user and stakeholder feedback</strong>, I iterated upon the design.</p>
        <img alt="Comparison of CacheCart design before and after" class="inline-borderless" src="img/cachecart4.png">
        <blockquote>Optional push notifications help users save money and provide monetization through promotions with grocery stores.</blockquote>
        <img alt="Screenshot of a promotional push notification" class="right" src="img/cachecart5.jpg">
        <p>I created a <strong>prototype</strong> with <strong>Adobe XD</strong>, allowing us to conduct <strong>usability tests</strong> before our final presentation.</p>
        <img alt="Screenshot of Adobe XD prototyping screen" class="inline" src="img/cachecart6.jpg">
        <p>The final presentation of our <strong>research, design, and prototype process</strong> earned us <strong>second place</strong> at the Student Design Competition. Presented here is the interactive prototype.</p>
